To extend and implement a custom compute mode, you need to over-ride the appropriate methods of the ```Base``` class.

Most of the methods of the ```BaseRunLogStore``` have default implementations and need not be over-written in a few 
situations.

Please refer to [*Guide to extensions* ](../../../extensions/extensions/) for a detailed explanation and the need for
implementing a *Integration* pattern along with the extension along with understanding the right example for your
extension.

In summary, the extension will fall into one of the four possible possibilities:

- Magnus traverses, execution environment same as traversal. eg: local
- Magnus traverses, execution environment not same as traversal. eg: local-container
- Magnus does not traverse, execution environment not same as traversal. eg: demo-renderer
- Magnus does not traverse, execution environment same as traversal. eg: 
[advanced use of as-is](../../../examples/#advanced_use_as-is)




Extensions that are being actively worked on and listed to be released as part of ```magnus-extensions```

- local-aws-batch : A decentralized AWS batch compute
- aws-step-function: Translates the dag into a Step function.

```python
# You can find this in the source code at: magnus/executor.py along with a few example 
# implementations of local, local-container, demo-renderer
class BaseExecutor:
    """
    The skeleton of an executor class.
    Any implementation of an executor should inherit this class and over-ride accordingly.

    The logic of any dag execution is a play between three methods of this class.

    execute_graph:
        This method is responsible for traversing A graph.
        The core logic is start at the start_at the graph and traverse according to the state of the execution.
        execute_graph hands over the actual execution of the node to self.execute_from_graph

        Helper method: prepare_for_graph_execution would be called prior to calling execute_graph.
            Use it to modify settings if needed.

    execute_from_graph:
        This method is responsible for executing a node.
        But given that a node itself could be a dag in cases of parallel, map and dag, this method handles the cases.
        If the node is of type task, success, fail: we can pretty much execute it and we call self.trigger_job.
        If the node is of type dag, map, parallel: We call the node's execute_as_graph function which internally
        triggers execute_graph in-turn iteratively traverses the graph.


    execute_node:
        This method is where the actual execution of the work happens.
        This method is already in the compute environment of the mode.
        Use prepare_node_for_execution to adjust settings.
        The base class is given an implementation and in most cases should not be touched.

        Helper method: prepare_for_node_execution would be called prior to calling execute_node.
            Use it to modify settings if needed

    The above logic holds good when we are in interactive compute mode i.e. local, local-container, local-aws-batch

    But in 3rd party orchestration mode, we might have to render the job specifications and the roles might be different

    Please see the implementations of local, local-container, local-aws-batch to perform interactive compute.
    And demo-renderer to see an example of what a 3rd party executor looks like.
