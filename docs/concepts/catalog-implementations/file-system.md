# FileSystem

This catalog provider uses local file system to store/retrieve the data generated by intermediate steps of the dag.

The complete configuration:
```yaml
catalog:
  type: file-system
  config:
    compute_data_folder :
    catalog_location:

dag:
  ...
```

## compute_data_folder

Catalog would need a local compute data folder to get/put the contents.
This is defaulted to ```data``` folder if nothing is provided.

Individual steps of the dag could over-ride this global default.

Example

```yaml
catalog:
  type: file-system
  config:
    compute_data_folder : data/

dag:
  start_at: Cool function
  steps:
    Cool function:
      type: task
      command: my_module.my_cool_function
      next: Success
      catalog:
        compute_data_folder: data/processed_data/
        get:
          - '*'
        put:
          - '*'
    Success:
      type: success
    Fail:
      type: fail
```

In this example, while the global default of the ```compute_data_folder``` is ```data/```, the step ```Cool function```
stored the generated data in ```data/processed_data/``` and this would be used for cataloging.

The same can also be achieved by using a glob pattern of ```processed_data/*``` if you prefer.

## catalog_location

By default, the catalog would be stored at ```.catalog``` of the root directory of the project. You can override this
by providing an alternate location.

Example:
```yaml
catalog:
  type: file-system
  config:
    catalog_location: /tmp/data
```

Would start using ```/tmp/data/``` to catalog the data.

!!! Note

    FileSystem catalog is only applicable if all of the steps are on the same compute.

    To re-run an older run on a different compute, you can simply place the files in the catalog location of the re-run
    if its not centrally accessible.
