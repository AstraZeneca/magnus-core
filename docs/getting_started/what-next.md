# Next Steps

We hope you got a good introduction to magnus and its features. We did not complicate the pipeline to keep it simple 
but there are many features that are interesting and might be of use to you in writing a robust pipeline. 

You can read about them in [Concepts](../../concepts/nodes) or see them in action in [Tutorials](../../tutorial/tutorial). 

You can even write [extensions](../../extensions/extensions) to magnus to see a feature that we 
have not implemented, guide to extensions is provided here.
