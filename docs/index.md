# **Welcome to Magnus**
*Lets do great things together!!*

Data science/engineering projects notoriously suffer from the *last mile problem*, where the idea and the experiment are 
constructed far away from the actual deployment. Historically, software engineering was prone to the same problem 
but found solutions in principles of **DevOps**, where the developer is bought closer to the operational world 
of the product they developed. 

Magnus aims to do the same to data science/engineering projects without exposing the data team to the underlying 
infrastructure complexity or inhibiting the experimental nature of the work. Magnus provides a framework and 
capabilities to apply the best of software engineering practices to data science projects without enforcing the 
rigidity and allowing for an incremental build of the engineering practices. 

Magnus does not aim to replace existing and well constructed orchestrators like AWS Step functions or 
argos but complements them in a unified, simple and intuitive way.
