# **Welcome to Magnus**
*Lets do great things together!!*

Data science projects notoriously suffer from the *last mile problem*, where the idea and the experiment are 
constructed far away from the actual deployment. Historically, software engineering was prone to the same problem 
but found solutions in principles of **DevOps**, where the developer is bought closer to the operational world 
of the product they developed. 

Magnus aims to do the same to data science projects without exposing the data scientists to the underlying engineering 
complexity or inhibiting the experimental nature of the work. Magnus tries to apply the best of software engineering 
practices to data science projects without enforcing the rigidity and allowing for an incremental build of the 
engineering practices. 

Magnus does not aim to replace existing and well constructed orchestrators like AWS Step functions or Kubeflow or 
argos but complements them in a unified, simple and intuitive way.
