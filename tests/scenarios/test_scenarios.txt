test traversal's with as-is nodes:
    - two node dag with terminal nodes
    - two node dag with first node failing
    - two node dag with first node failing and on_failure to second node
    - two node with one being parallel

Test the following scenarios:

For catalog settings:
1). Using get from the catalog at the start of the pipeline should error out.
2). Having no compute data folder should error out.


For nodes:
1). Simple dag with as-is nodes.
2). Dag with parallel branches
    a). Without parallel
    b). with parallel
3). Dag with map node.
    a). Without parallel
    b). with parallel
4). Dag with embedded dag.
    a). Without parallel
    b). with parallel
5). Nested/complex dag.
    a). Without parallel
    b). With parallel


For re-runs.

Do all the scenarios in local, local-container
