dag:

    This is a simple pipeline that does 2 parallel branches at step 2.
    Note that the branches schema is same as dag schema.

    All the steps are mocked and they will just pass through.
    Use this pattern to define the skeleton of your pipeline and flesh out the steps later.

    You can run this pipeline by:
       magnus execute -f example/parallel.yaml
  start_at: step 1
  steps:
    step 1:
      type: stub
      next: step 2
    step 2:
      type: parallel
      next: step 3
      branches:
        branch_a:
          start_at: step 1
          steps:
            step 1:
              type: stub
              next: step 2
            step 2:
              type: stub
              next: success
            success:
              type: success
            fail:
              type: fail
        branch_b:
          start_at: step 1
          steps:
            step 1:
              type: stub
              next: step 2
            step 2:
              type: stub
              next: success
            success:
              type: success
            fail:
              type: fail
    step 3:
      type: stub
      next: success
    success:
      type: success
    fail:
      type: fail
