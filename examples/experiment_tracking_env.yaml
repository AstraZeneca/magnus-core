      magnus execute -f examples/concepts/experiment_tracking_env.yaml \
      -c examples/configs/mlflow-config.yaml

  start_at: shell

      command_type: shell
      command: |
        export MAGNUS_TRACK_spam="hello"
        export MAGNUS_TRACK_eggs='{"ham": "world"}'
        export MAGNUS_TRACK_answer="42.0"
