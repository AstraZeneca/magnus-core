    This is a simple pipeline that does 3 steps in sequence.
    All the steps are mocked and they will just pass through.
    Use this pattern to define the skeleton of your pipeline and flesh out the steps later.
    You can run this pipeline by magnus execute -f example/getting-started-mock.yaml
  start_at: step 1
  steps:
    step 1:
      type: as-is
      next: step 2
    step 2:
      type: as-is
      next: step 3
    step 3:
      type: as-is
      next: success
    success:
      type: success
    fail:
      type: fail
