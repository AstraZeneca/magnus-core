    This is a simple pipeline that does 3 steps in sequence.
    We are using the same pipeline as getting-started-python.yaml but focussing on the logging levels.

    Log levels:
      magnus log level is different from your application log level. By default, it is set to WARNING but you can
      control it by using --log-level whlie calling application.

    To view only your application logs, you can execute this pipeline with:
      magnus run getting-started-python.yaml --log-level ERROR

  start_at: step 1
  steps:
    step 1:
      type: task
      command_type: python
      command: example.functions.return_parameter
      next: step 2
    step 2:
      type: task
      command_type: python
      command: example.functions.get_parameter
      next: success
    success:
      type: success
    fail:
      type: fail
